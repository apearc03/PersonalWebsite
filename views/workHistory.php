				   		<p>During summer 2017, I was selected to join the <a href = "https://www.pwc.co.uk/careers/offices/bristol.html" alt = "pwcBristol">PwC Bristol</a> office for a 6 week internship within their <a href = "https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/audit-assurance/risk-assurance/services/data-analytics-assurance.html" alt = "Data">Data Assurance</a> services. This was a fantastic experience as I was able to work in a very interesting field with some great individuals.</p>

				   		<p>The majority of my time was spent working on projects dealing with data sets and developing dashboards to visualise key data trends.</p>
				   		<p>I had a lot of exposure to technologies including:</p>

			     		<p id ="mainTask">The main project I was tasked with involved developing a dashboard within Qlik Sense to display utilisation of the Data Assurance team's hours. This meant creating a visually effective display of statistics and key performance indicators.</p>

			     		<p>This data was based upon the team's chargeable/non chargeable hours, type of clients and the services they were providing. The resulting dashboard made trends clear such as which team members were meeting chargeable hour targets and how the team's resources were being spent.</p>

			     		<p>During the internship I also had the opportunity to travel and work with clients. I joined the controls assurance team to take part in IT controls testing for <a href = "https://www.omega-pharma.com/en" alt = "omega">Omega Pharma</a>, a sub division of <a href = "https://www.perrigouk.co.uk/default.aspx" alt = "Perri">Perrigo</a>. This project involved regular communication with clients, meeting deadlines and working heavily with Aura Audit Software to assess the companies control protocols.</p>
			     		<p>Towards the end of the internship I was able to receive some valuable feedback on my time there.</p>

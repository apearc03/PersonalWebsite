					    <p> I recently graduated from <a href = "http://www.bbk.ac.uk/" alt = "bbk">Birkbeck, University of London</a> <!--with a MARK HERE --> with a Computing BSc. </p>
					    <p> I really enjoyed the course at Birkbeck, the content was very interesting and also challenging. The lecturers provided a great learning experience throughout the 4 years of study. I have definitely come away from the degree with a lot of useful knowledge and practical experience.
						 <p> 
					    <p>	
					    Below I have listed every module I studied whilst at Birkbeck. Each list item is a link to the official Birkbeck module page which contains a brief introduction along with content and objectives.
